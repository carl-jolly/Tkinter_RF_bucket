This file shows an example Tkinter GUI. The GUI allows the user to vary the RF voltage and phase of the bucket.

Possible extensions:
Add a slider to allow the user to change the initial distribution, currently its just a uniform "coasting" beam (line 26)
A button to add more particles into the simulation
A button to switch between h=2 and h=4 buckets
This is not an exhaustive list!
